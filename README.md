# knight_moves

Shows the shortest wave the knight needs to get from one point to another on standart chess board.
Use horizontal (from 0 to 7) and vertical (from 0 to 7) coordinates to set the initial and final position of the knight.<br>
Example:<br>
knight_moves([0,0], [3,5])<br>
Here [0,0] is a starting position, coordinate X is 0, coordinate Y is 0.<br>
[3,5] is a final position, coordinate X is 3, coordinate Y is 5.<br>
Result shows the shortest chain of positions with coordinates.
